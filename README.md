Knowledge Organization Systems (KOS) encompass all types of schemes for organizing information and promoting knowledge management. They are designed to facilitate the management and retrieval of information. [Hodge 2000]



## Knowledge Organization Systems Term Glossary
| Term | Definition | Source |
| -- | -- | -- |
| Authority File | A controlled vocabulary or official list that establishes, for consistency, the authoritative forms of headings and the preferred terms or proper names to be used when creating a catalog or when indexing and searching a set of entities within a defined domain. | [1] |
| Categorization scheme | Loosely formed grouping scheme | [2] |
| Category | A grouping of terms that are semantically or statistically associated but which do not constitute a strict hierarchy based on genus/species, parent/child, or part/whole relationships. | [5]. |
| Classification scheme | A method of organization according to a set of pre-established principles, usually characterized by a notation system and a hierarchical structure of relationships among the entities. | [5] |
| Classification scheme (alt) | schedule of concepts and pre-coordinated combinations of concepts, arranged by classification | [3] |
| Controlled Vocabulary | A collection of selected words and phrases related to a particular domain of knowledge used to permit consistency of metadata annotation and improved retrieval following a search, in which homonyms, synonyms, and similar ambiguities of meaning present in natural language are disambiguated. | [1] |
| Dataset | A collection of related facts, often expressed in numerical form and encoded in a defined structure. | [1]  |
| Deliverable  | A document containing a project report intended to be delivered to a customer or funding agency describing the results achieved within a specific project. | [1] |
| Described Value Domain | A value domain that is specified by a description or specification, such as a rule, a procedure, or a range (i.e., interval), rather than as an explicit set of permissible values | [7] |
| Enumerated Value Domain | A value domain that is specified by a list of all its permissible values | [7] |
| Glossary | A collection of textual glosses or of specialized terms with their meanings | [4] |
| Hierarchical Relationship | A relationship between or among terms in a controlled vocabulary that depicts broader (generic) to narrower (specific) or whole-part relationships; begins with the words broader term (BT) or narrower term (NT). | [5]  |
| List | A limited set of terms arranged as a simple alphabetical list or in some other logically evident way; containing no relationships of any kind | [5] |
| Narrower Term | A term that is subordinate to another term or to multiple terms in a hierarchy. In thesauri, the relationship indicator for this type of term is NT. | [5] |
| Ontology | A formal model that allows knowledge to be represented for a specific domain. An ontology describes the types of things that exist (classes), the relationships between them  (properties), and the logical ways those classes and properties can be used together (axioms). | [6] |
| Taxonomy | A classification arranged in a hierarchical structure of classes and subclasses, showing parent-child isA relationships, or broader_than - narrower_than relationships. | [1]  |
| Tree Structure | A controlled vocabulary display format in which the complete hierarchy of terms is shown. Each term is assigned a tree number or line number, which leads from the alphabetical display to the hierarchical one. The hierarchical display is also known as systematic display[5] |
| Uncontrolled Vocabulary | A non-defined collection of words and phrases relating to a particular domain of knowledge, usually added freely by a community, in which homonyms, synonyms and similar ambiguities of meaning present in natural language are not formally disambiguated. | [1] |
| Value Domain An enumerated array of valid values associated with a conceptual domain | [7]  |
| Vocabulary | A set of words, either constituting a language or, more specifically, used to describe a particular domain of knowledge. | [1] |
| Vocabulary Mapping | A mapping of correspondences between two vocabularies. For controlled vocabularies, such mappings may be expressed using SKOS (http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/). | [1] |
