# Ontologies

Ontologies are defined as a formal model that allows knowledge to be represented for a specific domain. An ontology describes the types of things that exist (classes), the relationships between them (properties) and the logical ways those classes and properties can be used together (axioms).
(Linked Data Glossary [https://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#ontology](https://www.w3.org/TR/ld-glossary/#ontology))

The distinction between ontology and vocabulary is not well-defined in practice. The table below contains both types of KOS resources.
