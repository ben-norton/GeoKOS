# Overview
The Geosciences Knowledge Organization Systems Registry (GeoKOS) is a repository of KOS resources in the Geosciences domain.
As described in Hodge (2000):
> The phrase ***Knowledge Organization Systems*** refers to an array of digital resources designed to organize 
> information and facilitate knowledge management. Knowledge organization systems encompass classification 
> schemes for general organization of materials, subject headings for more specific access, and authority 
> files for managing variant versions of important information, such as geographic and personal names. 
> In addition, they incorporate alternative approaches, such as semantic networks and ontologies. Knowledge 
> organization systems are fundamental tools for arranging and categorizing information, making them essential 
> components of libraries, museums, and archives.

## Types of Knowledge Organization Systems
The following table contains a modified version of the KOS Types Vocabulary as part of the Networked Knowledge Organization Systems Dublin Core Application Profile (NKOS AP)
| Type | Definition | Source |
| -- | -- | -- |
| categorization scheme | loosely formed grouping scheme |  [5] |
| classification scheme | schedule of concepts and pre-coordinated combinations of concepts, arranged by classification |  [3] |
| glossary | a collection of textual glosses or of specialized terms with their meanings |  [3] |
| list | a limited set of terms arranged as a simple alphabetical list or in some other logically evident way; containing no relationships of any kind |  [4] |
| name authority list | controlled vocabulary for use in naming particular entities consistently |  [3] |
| ontology | A formal model that represents knowledge for a specific domain. An ontology describes the types of things that exist (classes), the relationships between them (properties), and the logical ways those classes and properties can be used together (axioms). |  [6] |
| semantic network | set of terms representing concepts, modeled as the nodes in a network of variable relationship types |  [6] |
| subject heading scheme |  structured vocabulary comprising terms available for subject indexing, plus rules for combining them into pre-coordinated strings of terms where necessary |  [3] |
| synonym ring | set of synonymous or almost synonymous terms, any of which can be used to refer to a particular concept |  [3] |
| taxonomy | scheme of categories and subcategories that can be used to sort and otherwise organize items of knowledge or information |  [3] |
| terminology | set of designations belonging to one special language [ISO 1087-1:2000, definition 3.5.1] | [3] |
