# Metadata README
- Project: GeoKOS  
- Created: 2025-01-19  

The tables below provide a tabulated summary of the metadata schemes associated with GeoKOS. After an exhaustive inventory of KOS resource metadata schemes, two new schemes were created
as part of this project specifically to describe classification systems and controlled vocabularies. Both schemes should be considered in active developed. The terms are heavily based 
on existing schemes, but curtailed to meet the specific needs of KOS resources in the bioinformatics and geoinformatics domains. 

Links to the latest iteration of both schemes are provided below.

| Neuchâtel Terminology Model | 2.1 | 2004-06-18 | https://dzs.gov.hr/UserDocsImages/dokumenti%20EN/Neuchatelversion2.1.pdf?vel=218023 | The Neuchâtel Terminology was developed by the Neuchâtel group in an endeavour to arrive at a common language and a common perception of the structure of classifications and the links between them                                                                                              |
| XKOS: An SKOS extension for representing statistical classifications | 2019-05-01 | 2019-05-01 | https://rdf-vocabulary.ddialliance.org/xkos.html | An extension of SKOS for managing statistical classifications and concept management systems                                                       |
| Spesifikasjon for klassifikasjonsbeskrivelser (XKOS-AP-NO) | 1.0.2 | 2022-06-28 | https://data.norge.no/specification/xkos-ap-no | The purpose of the specification is to facilitate a common way of describing and making classifications available. A common way of describing the structure and content of a classification will make it easier for users of a classification to understand and use the classification correctly. |
