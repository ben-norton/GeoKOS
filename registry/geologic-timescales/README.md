# Geologic Timescales
Timescales are not readily identified as KOS Types, but are essential for the entire Geosciences Domain. The following contains a list of significant geologic timescales, including the type, units, source, and whether or not a copy is currently available in the GeoKOS Registry.

Timescales can be divided into groups based on temporal coverage, spatial coverage, and timescale units. 

| Group Name | Spatial Coverage | Temporal Coverage | Units |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| International Chronostratigraphic Chart | Global | All Earth's History | Chronostratigraphic |
| Geochronologic Timescale (GTS2020) | Global | All Earth's History | Geochronologic |
| Regional Timescales | Subcontinent, Country, to First Order Division | Varies | Chronostratigraphic |
| Land Mammal Ages | Continent-level | Pleistocene | N/A |

GTS2020 is the 'Gold Standard' for Timescales, a review activity that converges Chronostratigraphy, Magnetostratigraphy, Biostratigraphy, and Chemostratigraphy to produce a timescale in geochronologic units. See
