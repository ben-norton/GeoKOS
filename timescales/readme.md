# Geologic Timescales
Status: In Progress
## Overview
Timescales do not belong to traditional types of KOS resources. However, they provide a framework for relative ages, an essential function in the geosieneces domain. Therefore, they are included in GeoKOS in a separate section. The following contains a list of major geologic timescales that includes the type, units, source, and whether or not a copy is currently available in the GeoKOS Registry.

## Timescales characteristics - sets of characteristics with 100% domain coverage where every timescale can be assigned one value from each property set without any outliers. 
### Spatial Coverage
* Global 
* Regional
* Continental

### Temporal Coverage
* 0 - 4.567 Ga (All Earth's History)
* Pleistocene

### Units
* Geochronlogic 
* Chronostratigraphic

## Timescale Groups - based on the shared characteristic schemes listed above:
1. Regional Timescales
2. Chronostratigraphic
3. Geochronologic
4. Land Mammal Ages
