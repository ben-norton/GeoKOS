# Geologic Timescales
Status: In Progress
## Overview
Timescales are not traditional KOS resources. However, they provide a framework for relative ages, an essential function in the geosciences domain. Therefore, they are included in GeoKOS in a separate section. The following contains a list of major geologic timescales, including the type, units, source, and whether or not a copy is currently available in the GeoKOS Registry.

### Spatial Coverage
* Global 
* Regional
* Continental

### Temporal Coverage
* 0 - 4.567 Ga (All Earth's History)
* Pleistocene

### Units
* Geochronologic 
* Chronostratigraphic

## Timescale Groups - based on the shared characteristic schemes listed above:
1. Regional Timescales
2. Chronostratigraphic
3. Geochronologic
4. Land Mammal Ages
