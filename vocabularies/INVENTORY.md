| Geologic Feature Type | https://catalogue.linked.data.gov.au/resource/313 | geological-feature-type.ttl | AGLDWG Catalog | This vocabulary lists the fundamental types of geological features that are used to define the geological framework/4D evolution of Western Australia and are relevant to the duties of the Geological Survey of Western Australia. A geological feature is a physical or conceptual feature that is hypothesized to exist coherently in the Earth and that results from geological processes (definition largely derived from SWEET ontology http://sweetontology.net/realmGeol#geologicfeature). | Metamorphic Facies | https://catalogue.linked.data.gov.au/resource/320 | metamorphic-facies.ttl | A metamorphic facies is defined by a repeatedly occurring and thus predictable set of stable mineral assemblages in metamorphic rocks. Such metamorphic mineral assemblages crystallize and are stable over a range of externally imposed physical conditions, most crucially lithostatic pressure and temperature, and thus the facies define areas in two-dimensional plots of pressure–temperature space. |
| Geologic Unit Type | https://data.geoscience.fr/ncl/GeolUnitType | GeolUnitType.ttl | data-geoscience Vocabulary Linked Data Registry | |
| Rock Components | https://data.geoscience.fr/ncl/_RockComp | RockComp.ttl | data-geoscience Vocabulary Linked Data Registry | This register contains rocks component which are the particles or grains of a sedimentary rock linked together by a matrix or a cement. |
| Sample Type | https://catalogue.linked.data.gov.au/resource/489 | sample-type.ttl | AGLDWG Catalog | The form of a sample, i.e. the visible shape or configuration of a geological material. The listing includes both primary samples and derived specimens, that is primary sources (e.g. drillcore, hand specimen) and items resulting from preparation of those source materials for the purpose of research/analytical work (e.g. thin section, fine powder). |
| Mineral resources | https://schmar00.github.io/gba-thesaurus/ | minres.rdf | GeoSphere Austria | The vocabulary on "Mineral Resources" includes concepts related to the geological investigation on occurrences and deposits of mineral resources in Austria and is used to describe or encode datasets. |
