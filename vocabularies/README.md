# Vocabularies README
Last Modified: 2026-01-21

This directory contains an aggregate existing skos controlled vocabularies in the geosciences domain.  Source linked data files (rdf, ttl, etc.) are archived in the rdf directory and subsequently transformed into interoperable and human-friendly formats for review and reuse. 

Within the scope of the vocabularies, the term ***controlled vocabulary*** adheres to the following: 

A controlled vocabulary is an information content entity that is a collection of other information content entities that have been created to identify or annotate things in a specified domain, and where the intention of its creators is that the collection has a one-to-one correspondence with those things.*

Vocabulary for which the entries, i.e., definition/term pairs, are controlled by a Source Authority based on a rule base and process for addition/deletion of entries**

Each vocabulary represents all of the possible values in a particular scope which then could be reused to
establish a value domain for a term.
